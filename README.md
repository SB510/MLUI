# MLUI
The Goal of this project is to provide a simple UI for one to interact with the sklearn Machine learning library
  Currently it only provides a few options including running a small subset of algorithms and other variouse statistical analysis options
  in the near future variouse evaluation algorithms
  
  In the future I'd love to add another quick UI for editing Data inputed into the UI
